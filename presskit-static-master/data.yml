   Solve a series of physics puzzles by placing bumpers to create a constant flow of bouncing pinballs around the level. 
   Beware though, how you solve each puzzle will affect the next one in the series, as every screen you see is connected to the next one, forming a bigger, more complex level.
   Once you solve all the puzzles in a level, you can see the whole sequence unfold and admire your wits and good work.
